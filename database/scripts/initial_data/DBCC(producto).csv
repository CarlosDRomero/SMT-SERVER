In fact, it has nearly double the bandwidth of PCIe 3.0 for shorter download times and the ability to download more files within the same amount of time.
* An SSD's speed is meaningless without the ability to handle that speed reliably. The UD90 achieves improved sequential read/write and random read/write performance with support for SLC Caching. At the same time, it supports low density parity check (LDPC) coding to ensure accuracy of data transmission and reliability of data access.
* The UD90 supports RAID to protect data in the case of a drive failure. It's also equipped with built-in E2E data protection for enhanced data transfer integrity. Unexpected things can happen at any moment, but the UD90 is prepared for them with your data at its utmost priority.
